# Tug of War

## Motivation
Inspired from a Tug of War implementation I built for university using an FPGA.
The electrical implementation was an involved process - especially with analyzing timing diagrams when race conditions were ever present, and it had a substantially large project base for a relatively simple game. 
So, I wanted to see how a python script would compare in terms of size and performance building the same game on the Raspberry Pi with the GPIO module and a few LEDs.
